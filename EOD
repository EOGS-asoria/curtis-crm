Dear Maria Teresa Detalla,

    I am writing to formally resign from my position as Web Developer at Empireone Contact Center Solutions, effective today.

I have thoroughly enjoyed my time at Empireone and appreciate the opportunities I have had to grow both personally and professionally. The experiences and knowledge gained during my tenure have been invaluable, and I am grateful for the support and guidance provided by the team.

Please let me know how I can help during this transition period to ensure a smooth handover of my responsibilities. I am committed to ensuring that all ongoing projects are completed or appropriately handed off to a designated team member.

Thank you again for the opportunity to be a part of Empireone. I look forward to staying in touch and wish the company continued success in the future.

Sincerely,

Marlou Pepito
